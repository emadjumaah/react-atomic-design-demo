## Welcome!

This repository was built for a Lunch & Learn at my work and for a workshop at the Reactadelphia meetup. Its purpose is to demonstrate how Atomic Design can be used with React to create scalable applications that are quick to build and configure with minimal code changes.

I'm currently in the process of revamping the workshop to be easier to digest and more effective at demonstrating the power of Atomic Design.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
